## About

The "JSON Table Viewer" is a web application designed to facilitate the efficient display and exploration of JSON data. It enables users to load an array of JSON objects from either an API or a static file and presents the data in a tabular format. The table is created as a re-usable component with a flexible template using divs and flex layouts, ensuring responsiveness on different devices.

## Features

-Flexible Template

-Responsive Design

-Pagination

-Search Functionality


Flexible Template: Instead of using traditional HTML tables, the table rendering is accomplished using divs with flex layouts, enhancing flexibility and responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.

Responsive Design: The table is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Pagination: To manage large datasets efficiently, the table displays a configurable number of rows per page and supports pagination. Users can easily navigate through different pages of the table, and each page is bookmarkable, allowing seamless access to specific dataset views.

Search Functionality: The application includes a search box and a select list to specify the column for the search operation. Users can search for specific data within the loaded JSON objects, making it easier to locate relevant information quickly.

The "JSON Table Viewer" simplifies data visualization by presenting JSON object data in a user-friendly and interactive table format, complete with pagination and search features. Its responsive design ensures optimal usability on various devices, making it a valuable addition to any web development project.

## Installation

## Packages Installed

- "react-icons": "^4.10.1",

## Available Scripts

After installing all the necessary dependencies navigate to the Ui-Assignment directory and run the below command:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
